_How it works_

0 - ADMIN

admins get logs about registration/login of users


1 - REGISTRATION 

ðŸ§® Logic 
user submit  fullname + phone + password + type to firebase.users and to mongo.type

interfaces, api, redux

2 - LIGIN

ðŸ§® Logic
Firebase listener checks for stored/submited credentials then fetchs user from mongo

3 - FIRST VISITE 

first of all, your real name will appear only for teammates, choose a user name that is displayed on the platform.

choose an account type : manager/transporter

if manager :

- in order to use the platform you must create a team, now give it a name, and avatar. you can change them whenever you want

- do you wanna add people to team ? (optional), input username + type

- Accept Privacy policy.

if Transporter :

- do you have a team to join ?


4 - TEAMING UP

3aks a transporter, a manager is dedicated to one team, focusin on its multiple membres and its overload is the main purpose,
for a transporter, having multiple teams is making his process easier and also reducing its carburent and time costs.

ðŸ§® Logic

-- he can be own his own.
- Transporter can have multiple teams, manager have only one.
- Teams are public, everyone can see name of team and staff number, also activity.
- manager can recruit members.
- members will chat before joining

ðŸŽ¯ Marketing
